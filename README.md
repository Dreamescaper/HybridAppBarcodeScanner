# HybridAppBarcodeScanner

Barcode scaner sample built with [MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/) and [BlazorBindings.Maui](https://github.com/Dreamescaper/BlazorBindings.Maui). It uses BlazorWebView for the [main page](https://github.com/Dreamescaper/HybridAppBarcodeScanner/blob/master/Web/Pages/Barcode.razor), and MAUI native controls for [Barcode Scanner page](https://github.com/Dreamescaper/HybridAppBarcodeScanner/blob/master/Native/Pages/BarcodeScanner.razor), and both use razor syntax.
